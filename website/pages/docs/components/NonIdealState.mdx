# NonIdealState

import { Playground } from 'dokz'
import { Stack, Box, Image, Button } from '@chakra-ui/react'
import {
    DashboardLayout,
    Block,

    NonIdealState,

import InfoIcon from '../../../public/prisma/InfoIcon.svg'
import { FiSearch, FiAlertOctagon } from 'react-icons/fi'

This component lets you quickly show some visual feedback for non ideal states.

Non-ideal UI states inform the user that some content is unavailable. There are several types of non-ideal states, including:

-   **Empty state**: a container has just been created and has no data in it yet, or a container's contents have been intentionally removed.
-   **Loading state**: a container is awaiting data. A good practice is to show a spinner for this state, with optional explanatory text below the spinner.
-   **Error state**: something went wrong (for instance, 404 and 500 HTTP errors). In this case, a good practice is to add a call to action directing the user what to do next.

<Playground>
    <DashboardLayout p='6'>
        <NonIdealState
            icon={<Box opacity={.8} as={FiAlertOctagon} />}
            heading='You still have no servers'
            body='Servers are necessary to host services'
            cta={<Button size='sm'>Create a server</Button>}
        />
    </DashboardLayout>
</Playground>
